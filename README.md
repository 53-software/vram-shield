**VRAM Shield** is a professional system utility designed to protect modern laptop video memory (VRAM) from critical overheating.

## Why VRAM Shield?

Modern high-performance laptops often suffer from "Silent Overheating". While the GPU core remains cool, the VRAM chips can reach dangerous temperatures during AI generation, 3D rendering, or intensive gaming. This leads to hardware degradation and performance issues.

VRAM Shield solves this by intelligently managing GPU-heavy processes using **advanced mathematical logic**.

## Key Features

*   **Real-time VRAM Monitoring:** Precise tracking of memory temperature and hardware metrics.
*   **Pulse Throttling (FREE):** Reliable protection engine to keep temperatures under control.
*   **Smart Throttling (PRO):** Our premium engine that uses advanced mathematical logic for maximum performance and smooth gameplay.
*   **Panic Mode:** An emergency safety system that activates at critical thresholds to protect your hardware.
*   **Multilingual Interface:** Full support for 8 languages.

## Download & Installation

You can download the latest compiled version from the **[Releases](https://github.com/53-software/vram-shield/releases)** section.

1.  Download the latest `VRAMShield_X.X.X.exe`.
2.  Run the application as Administrator.
3.  **On first launch, VRAM Shield will automatically install and configure LibreHardwareMonitor for you.**
4.  Once installed, the application will start monitoring and protecting your VRAM.
